1. For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-5 sentences or point form notes explaining which features 
your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features you can either:

   - (a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to principle or

   - (b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

3. Write a paragraph about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your 
program to customers. This could be a specific category such as "students" or more vague, such as "people who 
like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

4. Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. 
For example, a program that converts txt files to files that can be printed by a braille printer are less likely to 
be used by people who do not read braille.
